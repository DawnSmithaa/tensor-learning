    "\n",
    "Large-scale and multidimensional spatiotemporal data sets are becoming ubiquitous in many real-world applications such as monitoring traffic and air quality. Making predictions on these time series has become a critical challenge due to not only the large-scale and high-dimensional nature but also the considerable amount of missing data. In this work, we propose a Bayesian Temporal Matrix Factorization (BTMF) model for modeling multidimensional time series - and in particular spatiotemporal data - in the presence of missing data. By integrating low-rank matrix factorization and autoregressive (AR) process into a single probabilistic graphical model, our model can effectively perform predictions without imputing those missing values. We develop efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for model inference and test the proposed BTMF on several real-world spatiotemporal data sets for both missing data imputation and short-term rolling prediction tasks."

    "We assume a spatiotemporal setting for multidimensional time series data throughout this work. In general, modern spatiotemporal data sets collected from sensor networks can be organized as matrix time series. For example, we can denote by matrix $Y\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times T}$ a multivariate time series collected from $N$ locations/sensors on $T$ time stamps, with each row $$\\boldsymbol{y}_{i}=\\left(y_{i,1},y_{i,2},...,y_{i,t-1},y_{i,t},y_{i,t+1},...,y_{i,T}\\right)$$\n",
