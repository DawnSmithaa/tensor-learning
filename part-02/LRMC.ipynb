    "If you search `matrix completion` as a keyword on [**wiki**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_completion), you might see the following explaination for the concept of matrix completion:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Matrix completion is the task of filling in the missing entries of a partially observed matrix. A wide range of datasets are naturally organized in matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this brief explaination, we could on the one hand see that the matrix completion task requires us to use a mainfold of approaches to impute the missing values for a given matrix which is partially observed. On the other hand, it seems that there are tremendous real-world datasets organized in matrix form, and this means that you have an access to solve real-world missing data problems using matrix completion techniques.\n",

    "**About this chapter**: This chapter does not intend to give a thorough review of low-rank matrix completion, but rather to highlight the basic idea of low-rank matrix completion, and to provide an overview of the key matrix completion techniques that have been successfully used. We direct the interested reader to the more focused references that are provided throughout the chapter.\n",

    "A strong motivation for the matrix completion in recommender systems comes from user ratings of some items like products, movies, or musics which are put into a matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$. The entries $x_{ij},\\forall i\\in\\left\\{1,...,m\\right\\},j\\in\\left\\{1,...,n\\right\\}$ of the matrix correspond to the $i$-th user's rating of item $j$.\n",

    "**Formal problem**: Suppose we observe partial entries of a matrix $\\boldsymbol{Y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, indexed by the set $\\Omega$. Then, the goal is to recover missing (or unobserved) entries in $\\boldsymbol{Y}$.\n",

    "> If we have a matrix like $\\boldsymbol{Y}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}{2} & {\\color{red}{?}} \\\\ {\\color{red}{?}} & {4}\\end{array}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$, which is obviously a partially observed matrix. The observed entries of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ can be indicated by the set $\\Omega=\\left\\{\\color{red}{(1,1),(2,2)}\\right\\}$. Applying the matrix completion technique, our final goal is find a recovered matrix like $\\boldsymbol{X}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}{2} & {\\color{red}{8}} \\\\ {\\color{red}{1}} & {4}\\end{array}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$."
